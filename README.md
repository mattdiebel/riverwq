# riverwq

[R Shiny app](https://wisconsindnr.shinyapps.io/riverwq/) for exploring river water quality trends in Wisconsin. Trends are characterized with WRTDS in [EGRET](https://github.com/USGS-R/EGRET).
Repository includes code to:
1. Assemble data
2. Fit models
3. Bootstrap models
4. Summarize models
5. Create shiny app

This code should be easily adaptable to new locations by editing the stations and parameters files.
